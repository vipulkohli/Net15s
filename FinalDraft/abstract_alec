Exploring and understanding the topology of a computer network provides valuable insight into the distribution of traffic, properties of central nodes, and the hierarchical structures of the network. The purpose of this paper is to represent the connectivity and physical media used throughout the Internet with a graph-based model as well as to explore the topology of international networks. This purpose is achieved through research and experimentation into Internet Service Provider (ISP) network maps, country demographics, and software tools for tracking packets through the Internet. Additionally, this paper explores the effects that network politics and privacy to the global Internet connectivity could potentially have on the routing patterns between the different types of ISP's that service both edge and transit core networks.
